# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Repository Overview

This is a personal portfolio website for Chryseis Liu, hosted on GitHub Pages. It's a simple HTML/CSS/JavaScript site showcasing:
- Personal bio and contact information
- Blog posts (currently one post)
- Photography collections (butterflies, nature, cityscapes)
- Projects section (currently "Coming soon")

## Architecture

This is a **static website** with the following structure:

```
/index.html                 # Main landing page with bio, blog preview, and photo gallery
/projects.html              # Projects page ("Coming soon" placeholder)
/blog-post-1.html           # Individual blog post page
/collection-*.html          # Individual photography collection pages (20+ pages)
/js/script.js               # Main JavaScript file
/style.css                  # All styling
/images/                    # Photography images organized in subdirectories
```

**Key architectural details:**

1. **No build process**: This is raw HTML/CSS/JS, no bundlers or transpilers
2. **GitHub Pages deployment**: The site deploys automatically when pushing to the `main` branch
3. **Local development**: Just open `index.html` directly in a browser - no server needed
4. **Responsive design**: CSS includes mobile-specific overrides

## Dynamic Content Generation

The photography section on `index.html` is dynamically generated by `js/script.js`:
- `photoCollections` object contains collection definitions (lines 88-173)
- Collections use actual folder names from `/images/` directory
- `generatePhotoCollections()` function creates gallery previews dynamically
- Clicking a collection navigates to its dedicated HTML page
- Dedicated collection pages contain their own image data for the gallery

### Adding New Photography Collections

To add a new collection:
1. Create folder in `/images/` with the collection name (e.g., `New Collection Name`)
2. Add photos to the folder
3. Add entry to `photoCollections` object in `js/script.js`:
```javascript
'New Collection Name': {
    title: 'New Collection Name',
    photos: ['photo1.jpg', 'photo2.jpg']
}
```
4. JavaScript will auto-generate gallery preview on index.html
5. If you need a dedicated collection page, duplicate an existing collection-*.html and update the filename and embedded image data

## Navigation System

**Four main navigation links:**
- Home (`#home`) - Main landing page
- Blogs (`#blogs`) - Blog preview section
- Photography (`#photography`) - Photo gallery
- Projects (`projects.html`) - Separate page

**Navigation behavior:**
- Hash links (`#section`) provide smooth scrolling on same page
- Cross-page links (e.g., `projects.html`) navigate to new pages
- Active state updates on scroll and click
- Supports direct hash navigation on page load

## Asset Management

**CSS version caching**: CSS file includes version query string (`style.css?v=1.5`). Increment this when making CSS changes to bust the cache.

**Photos**: Uploaded full-resolution images to `/images/{collection-name}/`.

**Font Awesome**: Using CDN for icons (`cdnjs.cloudflare.com`).

## Git Conventions

**Commit Messages:**
- Write in lowercase only
- Keep messages concise, natural, and lucid (human-like style, not robotic)
- Use short, clear descriptions (e.g., "remove p", "fix mobile background", "add projects tab")
- Avoid conventional commit prefixes like `docs:`, `fix:`, `feat:`

**Authorship:**
- Do NOT list Claude as co-author
- Do NOT include "Generated with Claude Code" or similar markings
- User's actual git credentials will be used automatically (username and email from git config)

**CLAUDE.md handling:**
- Do NOT commit CLAUDE.md to the repository
- Do NOT push CLAUDE.md to GitHub
- Keep CLAUDE.md local-only for your reference

**Deployment:**
- Git remote uses SSH: `git@github.com:Chryseisliu/chryseisliu.github.io.git`
- Changes deploy automatically to GitHub Pages when pushing to `main` branch

## Common Tasks

**Deploying changes:**
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "your message"
git push origin main
```
GitHub Pages will automatically deploy within seconds to minutes.

**Development workflow:**
- Edit HTML/CSS/JS files directly
- Open `index.html` in browser to test locally
- No build commands needed

**Adding a blog post:**
1. Create new HTML file (e.g., `blog-post-2.html`)
2. Add preview to index.html blog section (lines 50-58)

**CSS changes:**
- Increment version in CSS link tag to bust cache: `style.css?v=X.X`

## Important Notes

- **Mobile styling**: Multiple commits show struggle with mobile background rendering. Current CSS has mobile-specific media queries and background handling.
- **No package.json**: No Node.js dependencies or build scripts
- **No test suite**: No automated tests
- **No linting**: No configured linters
- **Static site generator**: None used - this is hand-written HTML/CSS/JS

## Troubleshooting

**Changes not appearing on live site:**
- Wait 30-60 seconds for GitHub Pages to deploy
- Increment CSS version number to bust cache
- Check browser cache (hard refresh: Ctrl/Cmd + Shift + R)
- Verify changes were pushed to `main` branch

**Photography images not loading:**
- Verify folder names in `/images/` match collection keys exactly
- Check browser console for 404 errors on image paths
- Ensure images are committed to git repository
